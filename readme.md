# AI Connect Four

This repository contains two versions of the Connect Four game implemented in Python along with AI opponents using different algorithms: Alpha-Beta Pruning and Monte Carlo Simulation.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning Version

The Alpha-Beta Pruning version of Connect Four implements an AI opponent using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm. This algorithm is a search algorithm commonly used in decision trees and game playing.

### Usage

To play the game against the Alpha-Beta Pruning AI:

1. Navigate to the `connect-4-ab-prunning` directory.
2. Run the `connect-4.py` script.
3. Follow the prompts to play against the AI opponent.

## Monte Carlo Version

The Monte Carlo version of Connect Four implements an AI opponent using the Monte Carlo Simulation algorithm. This algorithm is a probabilistic method for estimating the possible outcomes of a decision by simulating random outcomes.

### Usage

To play the game against the Monte Carlo AI:

1. Navigate to the `connect-4-monte-carlo` directory.
2. Run the `connect-4.py` script.
3. Follow the prompts to play against the AI opponent.

## Requirements

Both versions of the game require Python 3.x to be installed on your system.

Additionally, the following Python packages are used:

- `numpy`: For efficient numerical operations.
- `termcolor`: For colored output in the terminal.

You can install these packages using pip
